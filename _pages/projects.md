<h2 id="mfl">Materials for Learning </h2>
<p align="justify">We will offer modular cybertraining frameworks that can be customized to the needs of specific disciplines in geoscience. Our training and development pathway (right) will parallel the progression of knowledge and tool skillsets (left) needed to apply ML for a specific research application.</p>

<p align="justify">The GeoSMART educational pathways build upon fundamental building blocks: i) basics of data science, computing and cyberinfrastructure, ii) ML tools, and iii) research project development.
</p>

These online resources will be designed to host: 

<ul>
<li> pre-developed learning modules on data science and ML basics </li>

<li>  hackweek training tutorials and video recordings  </li>

<li> scientific use case example computational workflows </li>

</ul>
<p align="justify">Our tutorials and use cases will use principles of active learning methods including problem-based learning, peer-learning and collaborative and cooperative learning. Based on our experience leading hackweeks, we will initially build tutorial teams from our existing networks of data science partners, and over time we will recruit past participants to lead future training. Our unrestricted publicly accessible content will catalyze the adoption of ML CI and will be the foundation for future collaborations and development of community shareable code

<h2 id="cm">Materials for Classroom Teaching and Curriculum Development </h2>
<p align="justify">
We aim to develop educational materials that will contain an à-la-carte menu of lectures, tutorials, and a collection of research-style course projects. We will consolidate this material in a 10-12 week, four part multi-credit course covering: 1) basics in software carpentry and access to cloud resources for 1-2 weeks, 2) introduction to ML tools for geosciences on small data sets for 3 weeks, 3) development and deployment of these tools to larger datasets as part of a course projects for 6-10 weeks, 4) project reporting with presentations, best practices for sharing open-source software, and tutorial development. The class materials will be Jupyter Notebook-based tutorials with samples of datasets, recorded lectures, links to Cloud computing resources and tutorials maintained by the eScience Institute, links to stored curated data sets, GitHub repositories of past group projects. This repository (M. Denolle’s class at the University of Washington) is an example of class curriculum taught in the area of seismology at the University of Washington. Our ML applications will cover several research areas (seismology, hydrology, cryosphere) and levels of difficulty ranging from simple problems to complex use cases.

<h2 id="sfc">Building and Supporting ML GeoScience Communities</h2>
<p align="justify">
With our materials and training events in ML tools and fundamentals of ML theory we aim to build a community interested in our offerings. In addition to our online materials, we plan to host GeoSMART <a href="https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service/intro.html" target="_blank">hackweek</a> events. 

Hackweeks are time-bounded events that blend elements of a summer school with open project work or "hacking", and are designed in a way that encourages immersive, interactive learning in a space that is welcoming to people of all backgrounds. The content within a hackweek is intentionally designed co-creatively with participants, and there are facilitated opportunities for networking and community building.

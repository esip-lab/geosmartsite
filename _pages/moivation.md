(Geo)Data has a better idea

Machine learning offers tools that are particularly well suited to addressing research challenges in geosciences. Many fundamental earth system processes such as fluid and solid dynamics, affecting everything from crustal deformation to climate patterns, are non-linear and not well represented in existing deterministic models. It is also difficult to measure all components of the systems we are studying (e.g. the base of an ice sheet or a continental plate boundary), but we often can measure the second order impacts of these physical systems (e.g. ice sheet surface velocity or GPS uplift rates). ML provides novel approaches for discovering trends in these observations that may illuminate new understandings of driving physical processes. Traditional geoscience modeling uses a top-down approach based on our understanding of the physical processes and their representation in physics-based models, but it is limited by that particular representation. In contrast, ML can discover patterns and trends in large amounts of data, as it is based on a bottom-up approach in which algorithms learn relationships between input data and output. ML models are also highly efficient and, in some cases, more accurate because of their flexibility to accommodate nonlinearity and/or nonGaussianity. Recent approaches combine physics-based modeling from domain science with ML for building powerful prediction systems that are performant and easier to interpret. 

ML adoption in classrooms

With recent computational hardware innovations such as graphics processing units (GPUs), as well as innovations in ML methods themselves, ML is positioned to assist geoscientists by exploiting untapped environmental observations and enhancing Earth system modeling in timely and cost-effective ways. However, reproducible ML workflows require sophisticated coupling of advanced software, data processing pipelines, visualization tools, and rapidly evolving Cloud-based CI. We believe that adopting ML curriculum in classrooms has great potential for advancing ML-based discovery in the geosciences through hands-on teaching and project work.

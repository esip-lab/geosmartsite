<h2>Materials for Classroom Teaching and Curriculum Development </h2>
<p align="justify">
We aim to develop educational materials that will contain an à-la-carte menu of lectures, tutorials, and a collection of research-style course projects. We will consolidate this material in a 10-12 week, four part multi-credit course covering: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>basics in software carpentry and access to cloud resources for 1-2 weeks</li>
<li>introduction to ML tools for geosciences on small data sets for 3 weeks</li>
<li>development and deployment of these tools to larger datasets as part of a course projects for 6-10 weeks</li>
<li>project reporting with presentations, best practices for sharing open-source software, and tutorial development</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">
The class materials will be Jupyter Notebook-based tutorials with samples of datasets, recorded lectures, links to Cloud computing resources and tutorials maintained by the eScience Institute, links to stored curated data sets, GitHub repositories of past group projects. This repository (M. Denolle’s class at the University of Washington) is an example of class curriculum taught in the area of seismology at the University of Washington. Our ML applications will cover several research areas (seismology, hydrology, cryosphere) and levels of difficulty ranging from simple problems to complex use cases.

<h2 id="sfc">Building and Supporting ML GeoScience Communities</h2>
<p align="justify">
With our materials and training events in ML tools and fundamentals of ML theory we aim to build a community interested in our offerings. In addition to our online materials, we plan to host GeoSMART <a href="https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service/intro.html" target="_blank">codeweek</a> events. 

Hackweeks are time-bounded events that blend elements of a summer school with open project work or "hacking", and are designed in a way that encourages immersive, interactive learning in a space that is welcoming to people of all backgrounds. The content within a hackweek is intentionally designed co-creatively with participants, and there are facilitated opportunities for networking and community building.

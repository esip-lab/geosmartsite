<h2>Supporting Machine Learning Education and Innovation in the GeoSciences.</h2>
<p align="justify">
This project supports the development of a research workforce capable of advancing fundamental Geoscience challenges through broad adoption of Machine Learning (ML) tools.  Our GeoScience MAchine Learning Resources and Training (GeoSMART) framework provides an educational pathway that provides a foundation in open source scientific ecosystems and progresses through general ML theory, toolkits and deployment on Cloud computing.

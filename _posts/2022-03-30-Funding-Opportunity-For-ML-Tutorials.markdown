title:  "Funding Opportunities For ML Tutorials"

<p>
    Contribute to the GeoSMART curriculum by developing a tutorial notebook! Earth Science 
    Information Partners (ESIP) and GeoSMART are requesting researchers transitioning their 
    machine learning (ML) workflows into well-documented, interactive, and shareable tutorials 
    to submit a proposal. We seek tutorials related to hydrology, seismology, and/or the cryosphere.
